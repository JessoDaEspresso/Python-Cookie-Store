# Python-Cookie-Store

This program was created to teach myself python classes, GUI creation and csv manipulation. The program is by no means
professional, and multiple changes would need to be made to optimize the code, and expand its use cases.

The code as it is does not support the "purchase" of more than one cookie, this is because the main focus of the
project was not to make a functioning storefront, but more so as a learning experience for myself intended to teach me
how to work with classes, gui creation, and csv manipulation in Python.

In the future, I would like to make it compatible with a "multiple" cookie checkout option. For now however,
I think the program shows off the basics of GUI Design, and the use of classes in Python.

I will primarily be using this for portfolio purposes and code referencing
